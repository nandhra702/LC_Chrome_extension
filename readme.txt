This is the readme file for the LC_Chrome_extension project
So, 2 parts :

1. USER BOOKMARKS THE QUESTION
    ----> When the user is on LC and finds a question he wants to bookmark, he will simply add the question to the extension by clicking on the extension.
          The extension picks up the question name and number automatically (Through tags). 
          The user adds a short question description and an overview of the solution (Maybe testcases too).
          Also, we will add the URL of the page as a link to the question.

2. USER OPENS CHROME 
    ----> On opening a new tab, the LC question of the day is displayed on the homepage of the browser.
          The user can click on it, and read the question of the day.
